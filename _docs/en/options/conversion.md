All the settings of conversion are combined in the presets. This allows you to switch between them at the same time, such as when a project or display changing.

To create a new preset, should:

  *  Select the most appropriate of the existing;
  *  Change settings;
  *  Save its with new name.

If you remove all of the existing presets, the application recreates presets by default when you open the settings window.
